## Introduction

The app should take an instruction file in order to command a robot.
Once the robot is done with all the commands, the app should return the cleaned area (deducing the multiple passages on the same area).

The first line in the instruction file contains the number of commands (integer).

The second line contains the starting coordinates (two integers separated by a space).

The following lines contain the commands (a capital letter for the compass direction, N, S, E, W and an integer for the number of steps, both values are separated by a space).
